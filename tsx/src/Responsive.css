/*

Normally, design would be mobile-first: all
default styling would be mobile-friendly and
then get overriden, for sufficiently capable
output devices, with more space-hungry
variations.

React, however, is too retarded to acknowledge this.

It will make the sub-component CSS imports
overwrite this and to stop it you'd have to import
this file as the last, immediately breaking Reacts's
default ESLint demand to have your imports sorted.
