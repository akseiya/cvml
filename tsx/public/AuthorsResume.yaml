        1.  BDD and shift-left evangelism in the squad and around it, including

        Initially an attempt to liaise between 3 parties to deliver
        a learning project with associated materials and processes. After
        communications with the customer contact collapsing, I focused on
        creating
        * a [code exercises sandbox](#the_w3schools_wannabe) inspired by W3Schools and
        * the first learning module delivered by it.

        The project served as a clear indication where my consultancy and management
        skills have their limits. That is: I don't really function well as an
        unsupported hub with high-difficulty partners on all sides. I need
        at least one solid wall to put my back against.

        # Summary

        I converted an ailing QA team into a functional Test Engineering chapter
        in a Scaling Agile model.

        The process involved:
        * defining roles and development paths for my engineers, then training them
          in the skills required to progress on those paths;
        * identifying my engineers' individual strengths and leveraging them,
          adjusting their deployment to squads as needs changed;
        * working closely with Product Lead developing BDD practices across the
          prod/tech teams and then fleshing out the squad-specific details with product
          owners;
        * contributing to the evolving Scaling Agile model, including some of
          the company's first OKR's;
        * steering the development of technical tools to keep the processes going
          smoothly, delegating as much of coding as possible to the engineers (against
          my natural tendencies which would interfere with my engineers' growth).

        # Results

        QA team with 2 permanent employees trying to move to Front End Development became
        a Test Engineering chapter with 2 contractors considered indispensable by their
        squads and 4 permanent engineers contributing to constant improvement of the product
        and their own skillsets, be it learning to create E2E frameworks, harnessing mobile
        testing regimes or using psychological wiles to sway the least BDD-open of product
        owners.

        Unit test coverage for front-end code became an actual tracked parameter
        and jumped to over 70% within a few months since our initial spiking sessions
        for Mocha/Chai and React tools for testing.

        A pre-mature attempt to deliver vision and strategy for a young startup's
        Quality Engineering. While I managed to deliver a bunch of nifty tools and
        processes, I resigned after realising I don't really have much of a vision
        to share just yet.

        # Duties

        * Evolution of the [non]-"smoke" testing pipeline from Aframe, redesigned for much
          easier developer onboarding (by pairing with several prospective victims),
          re-wired to depend less on Selenium WebDriver capabilities and finally, fully
          integrated with existing development process in Bamboo. Delivery included
          installation scripts for local runs of the suite, Bamboo plans to allow remote
          use and training sessions for the team, from generic introduction to problem
          solving descents and troubleshooting approach.
        * High-level design and initial coding of the framework for multi-tenancy isolation
          testing.
        * High-level design for the actual smoke tests of production infrastructure and
          its staging copy.
        * Tracking and helping the developers' work during release testing rushes.
          This included a test sheet in Google Docs, which initial content was imported
          from JIRA with a Capybara script (as opposed to using actual import facilities
          which would mark accepting of Google Docs as a decent test tracking tool).

      This resume is a YAML document rendered with React.

      Use the hamburger icon **≡** in the top right corner to
      ***edit the YAML*** source and change currently rendered content.

      As long as the main sections (`name`, `fundamentals`,
      `summary`, `career`, `projects`, `extras`) are present and
      the format is conserved, any compatible data can be rendered,
      including your own CV.

      Under development. Future ideas will be added to its
      [README](https://github.com/akseiya/cvml/tree/main/tsx#readme).

  - The W3Schools wannabe: |-
      A jQuery-based course delivery system, working with concept of
      learning modules and their stages as navigable sequences of web pages,
      some of which can contain interactive code exercises.

      The content authored in Markdown would be rendered with
      [Showdown](https://showdownjs.com/), while code exercises have
      a bit more logic behind them (ultimately, a shell command gets executed
      in the backend to run the tests), including expected phrases and
      hints for the learner as well as basic protection against `rm -rf /`
      and similar shenanigans.

      The exercise delivered while implementing the framework prototype is "API Testing
      in C#", made for [Coforge](#career-shred).

  - Ergane: |-
      An ***almost*** run-of-the-mill, project-aligned, E2E testing framework.

      Written in Python with *Behave* and *Request* for BT's [Athena/Vena
      project](#career-athena).

      Designed for boilerplate minimisation when extending, not just for page objects,
      but - more importantly - for cluster-specific Vault paths, hostnames etc - leading
      to a situation where typically adding support for a new API meant specifying
      the core of its name.

      A cascase of gradual overrides made sure that "rebels" and legacy code required
      merciful amounts of extra code.

      The framework came with tailored workflow and associated GitLab CI/CD pipeline
      stages, including a way to run super-slow overnight e2e tests with physical
      Juniper routers, a HA-Proxy instance allowing use of the same
      cluster for internal and external E2E regimes, finally cross-poject hooks in
      the pipelines to work around the missing budget for full GitLab license.

  - Orion: |-
      ...a.k.a. [NYSE's](#career-nyse) Next Generation Market Data System.

      My chief effort was extensive scripting in Python, including:
      * The Universal Playback Parser (**UPP**) for wide variety of market data formats,
        from delimited ASCII to pure binary.
        * The parser used CSV exports of business requirements (sheets with fields'
        meaning) and a symbol-based language for specifying the feed's underlying
        format.
      * The Pretty Printer script filtering and presenting the UPP-decoded market
        data in usable formats (JSON or human-readable).
      * Automatic data checker, using the UPP to parse north and south side data:
        * simulates key parts of Orion's functionality using a CSV spreadsheet with
          mappings of messages, fields and logical conditions;
        * scans current message routing configuration (XML) and simulates proper routing
        * compares resulting data streams and reports items lost, modified and unexpected.
