  - Key achievements: |-
      Converted an ailing QA team into a [functional Test
      Engineering chapter](#career-fuse) in a scaling agile model.

      Drove [a broad adoption of BDD across tech and
      product](#career-fuse), up to the point of product owners
      becoming able to challenge numerous feature requests submitted
      as bugs (on top of the usual BDD benefits).

      Allowed [NYSE](#career-nyse) to run performance tests of its Data Fabric
      system using a rented cluster of custom worker machines and my
      mini-jMeter written in Python.
      
      Enabled daily deploys for BT's [Vena project](#career-athena)
      through a multi-layered portfolio of test suites and deployment
      pipelines with emergency mitigation processes in place, adapted to

      Reduced run-time of [DuCo's unit test suite](#career-duco) from
      a few minutes to 7 seconds.

      Gatekept a number of showstoppers from production with [my first
      webdriven end-to-end testing suite](#career-aframe) and then optimised
      myself out of the structure when the market still forced my favourite
      start-up to cut the workforce.

        Contracting as Hariel Imamiah Ltd for BT's Athena ("Vena") project.

        # Duties

        The [aforementioned daily deploy](#summary) required various components
        in place, including:
        * the well received E2E testing framework in Python, [Ergane](#ergane);
        * the devops side to enable differently paced late-stage quality gates
          across all the squads on the project: deployment scripts (k8s), Helm
          charts and gitLab CI/CD workflows, standalone mocks, proxies etc.

        Within my squad, I improved our code confidence
        by replacing a Robot Framework-based perfect silo with
        a squad-maintained CCIT suite. This also involved preaching BDD and
        shift-left to my squad and around it, introducing Cucumber (used
        correctly) and Pact.

        Vena was my first instance of
        achieving a noticeable improvement in the ways of working as a
        ground-level "influencer" rather than an appointed leader.

        1.  Line management as per the corporate policies (including use of

            peer ratings).
        1.  Serving as the testing Amigo, driving the shift-left in

        It turned out my (and others') leadership was of unacceptably ephemeral
        nature: the ways-of-working standards, painstakingly worked out between
        the 3 Amigos and the rest of the pod got abruptly overturned by a
        mid-level manager without asking pre-intervention questions or providing
        any explanations until demanded.

        I did not take it lightly and made sure to explain my position on
        the exit interview, so now I'd rather explain myself before the
        corporation gets asked for my references.

        # Summary

        The [aforementioned](#summary) building of a Test Engineering chapter
        involved:
        * defining roles and development paths for my engineers, then training
          them in the skills required to progress on those paths;
        * identifying my engineers' individual strengths and leveraging them,
          adjusting their deployment to squads as needs changed;
        * working closely with Product Lead developing BDD practices across the
          prod/tech teams and then fleshing out the squad-specific details with
          product owners;
        * contributing to the evolving broader scaling agile model, including
          some of the company's first OKR's;
        * steering the development of technical tools to keep the processes
          going smoothly, delegating as much of coding as possible to the
          engineers (against my personal tendencies which would interfere with
          my engineers' growth).

        # Results

        The 2 permanent QA testers I started with were no longer focused on
        moving to front-end development, instead becoming Test Engineers in a
        Spotify-inspired chapter of 6.

        Contracting was reduced to 2 special cases: a virtuoso of exploratory
        testing and a dev-ops-specialised engineer deemed irreplaceable by our
        Head of Platform.

        As a side effect of the integration testing spikes I've run with
        our Head of Front-End, unit test coverage for front-end code became
        an actual tracked parameter and jumped to over 70% within a few sprints.

        Broad adoption of BDD had additional results, including clear,
        documented and tracked path from ideation to code - which also allowed
        the team to spot and address more gaps in the process - like change
        requests accepted as bugs or impact of a completely separate team
        creating full front-end override of our product in an isolated pipeline.
        This is also what I sadly believe was the root cause for our CTO's
        departure (and me following him out).

      This resume is a YAML document rendered with React.

      Use the hamburger icon **≡** in the top right corner of [this
      page](https://akseiya.github.io) to ***edit the YAML*** source and change
      currently rendered content.

      As long as the main sections (`name`, `fundamentals`,
      `summary`, `career`, `projects`, `extras`) are present and
      the format is conserved, any compatible data can be rendered,
      including an entirely different CV.

      There are no error boundaries yet. Breaking the YAML badly will
      render a blank HTML page. Thou hast been warned.

      Under development. Future ideas will be added to its
      [README](https://github.com/akseiya/cvml/tree/main/tsx#readme).

  - The W3Schools wannabe: |-
      A course delivery system treating learning modules and their stages as
      navigable sequences of webpages - some of which can contain interactive
      code exercises. Source currently on Bitbucket, ask me for access.

      The prose content authored in Markdown is rendered with
      [Showdown](https://showdownjs.com/), while code exercises have
      a bit more logic behind them (ultimately, a shell command gets executed
      in the backend to run the tests), including expected phrases and
      hints for the learner as well as basic protection against `rm -rf /`
      and similar shenanigans.

      The exercise delivered while implementing the framework prototype is "API
      Testing in C#", made for [Coforge](#career-shred).

  - Ergane: |-
      An ***almost*** run-of-the-mill, project-aligned, E2E testing framework.

      Written in Python with *Behave* and *Request* for BT's [Athena / Vena
      project](#career-athena).

      Designed for boilerplate minimisation when extending, not just for page
      objects, but - more importantly - for cluster-specific Vault paths,
      hostnames etc - leading to a situation where typically adding support for
      a new API meant specifying the core of its name.

      A cascade of gradual overrides made sure that "rebels" and legacy code
      required merciful amounts of extra code.

      The framework came with tailored workflow and associated GitLab CI/CD
      pipeline stages, including a way to run super-slow overnight e2e tests
      with physical  Juniper routers, a HA-Proxy instance allowing use of the
      same cluster for internal and external E2E regimes, finally cross-poject
      hooks in the pipelines to work around the missing budget for full GitLab
      license.

  - Orion: |-
      ...a.k.a. [NYSE's](#career-nyse) Next Generation Market Data System.

      My chief effort was extensive scripting in Python, including:
      * The Universal Playback Parser (**UPP**) for wide variety of market data
        formats, from delimited ASCII to binary-encoded FIXML.
        * The parser used CSV exports of business requirements (sheets with
          fields' meaning) and symbol-based [de-]serialisation specs.
      * The Pretty Printer script filtering and presenting the UPP-decoded
        market data in usable formats (JSON or human-readable).
      * Automatic data checker, using the UPP to parse north and south side
        data:
        * simulates key parts of Orion's functionality using a CSV spreadsheet
          with mappings of messages, fields and logical conditions;
        * scans current message routing configuration (XML) and simulates proper
          routing;
        * compares resulting data streams and reports items lost, modified
          and unexpected.
