        be at any moment overturned by a mid-level manager without asking me any questions
        or providing any explanations.

        Initially an attempt to liaise between 3 counterparties to deliver
        a learning project with associated materials and processes. After
        communications with the customer contact collapsing, I focused on
        creating a [code exercises sandbox inspired by W3Schools and the first
        learning module delivered by it](#the_w3schools_wannabe).

        The project served as a clear indication where my consultancy and management
        skills have their limits. That is: I don't really function well when completely
        exposed on all sides with a high-difficulty "partner" on each side. I need
        at least one solid wall to put my back against.

            workflows, auxiliary tools (standalone mocks, proxies etc).
        1.  BDD and shift-left evangelism in the squad and around it, including
            introduction of Cucumber and Pact. It was my first instance of achieving
            a noticeable improvement in the ways of working as a ground-level "influencer"
            rather than an appointed leader. I blame my squad (the excellent Olives) and

        # Summary

        I converted an ailing QA team into a functional Test Engineering chapter
        in a Scaling Agile model.

        The process involved:
        * defining roles and development paths for my engineers, then training them
          in the skills required to progress on those paths;
        * identifying my engineers' individual strengths and leveraging them, adjusting
          their deployment to dev teams as needs changed;
        * working closely with Product Lead developing BDD practices across the prod-tech
          teams and then fleshing out the squad-specific details with product owners;
        * contributing to the evolving Scaling Agile model, inluding some of the company's
          first OKR's;
        * steering the development of technical tools to keep the processes going
          smoothly, delegating as much of coding as possible to the engineers (against
          my natural tendencies which would interfere with my engineers' growth).

        # Results

        QA team with 2 permanent employees trying to move to Front End Development became
        a Test Engineering chapter with 2 contractors considered indispensable by their
        squads and 4 permanent engineers contributing to constant improvement of the product
        and their own skillsets, be it learning to create E2E frameworks, harnessing mobile
        testing regimes or using psychological wiles to sway the least BDD-open of product
        owners.

        Unit test coverage for front-end code became an actual tracked parameter
        and jumped to over 70% within a few months since our initial spiking sessions
        for Mocha/Chai and React tools for testing.

        A pre-mature attempt to deliver vision and strategy for a young startup's
        Quality Engineering. While I managed to deliver a bunch of nifty tools and
        processes, I resigned after realising I don't really yet have a vision
        to share.

        # Duties

        * Evolution of the [non]-"smoke" testing pipeline from Aframe, redesigned for much
          easier developer onboarding (by pairing with several prospective victims),
          re-wired to depend less on Selenium WebDriver capabilities and finally, fully
          integrated with existing development process in Bamboo. Delivery included
          installation scripts for local runs of the suite, Bamboo plans to allow remote
          use and training sessions for the team, from generic introduction to problem
          solving descents and troubleshooting approach.
        * High-level design and initial coding of the framework for multi-tenancy isolation
          testing.
        * High-level design for the actual smoke tests of production infrastracture and
          its staging copy.
        * Tracking and helping the developers' work during release testing rushes.
          This included a test sheet in Google Docs, which initial content was imported
          from JIRA with a Capybara script (as opposed to using actual import facilities
          which would mark accepting of Google Docs as a decent test tracking tool).

        1.  Complementing the platform with a custom Git workflow standing in for a part
            of a CI/CD pipeline we did not exactly have at the time.

            back towards testing fully distributed among the developers.

projects:
  - CVML: |-
      This resume is a YAML document rendered with React.

      "Flat mode" *(switch by using the red button up top, restore with the green one
      it turns into)* is meant for HR and recruiters  who, for some dark purpose,
      need to have in Word. It should be a bit easier to copypaste and format.

      Career entries are expected to have start and end months etc (view the YAML to see
      examples) for sorting (I actually managed to mis-order jobs when importing from
      the old HTML version) and collapsing old enties, as well as some structure to
      information about the companies and positions.

      At some point I intend to make it fully interactive, including the options to
      create/edit someone else's CV and export/load it as a YAML document or its
      base64 blob.

  - The W3Schools wannabe: |-
      A jQuery-based course delivery system, working with concept of
      learning modules and their stages as navigable sequences of web pages,
      some of which can contain interactive code exercises.

      The content authored in Markdown would be rendered with Showdown, while code
      exercises have a bit more logic behind them (ultimately, a command gets executed
      in the backend to run the tests), including expected phrases and hints for the
      learner as well as basic protection against `rm -rf /` etc.

      The exercise delivered while implementing the framework prototype is "API Testing
      in C#", made for [Coforge](#career-shred).

  - Ergane: |-
      An ***almost*** run-of-the-mill, project-aligned, E2E testing framework.

      Written in Python with *Behave* and *Request* for BT's [Athena/Vena
      project](#career-athena).

      Designed for boilerplate minimisation when extending, not just for page objects,
      but - more importantly - for cluster-specific Vault paths, hostnames etc - leading
      to a situation where typically adding support for a new API meant specifying
      the core of its name.

      A cascase of gradual overrides made sure that "rebels" and legacy code required
      merciful amounts of extra code.

      The framework came with tailored workflow and associated GitLab CI/CD pipeline
      stages, including a way to run super-slow overnight e2e tests with physical
      Juniper routers, a HA-Proxy instance allowing use of the same
      cluster for internal and external E2E regimes, finally cross-poject hooks in
      the pipelines to work around the missing budget for full GitLab license.

  - Orion: |-
      ...a.k.a. [NYSE's](#career-nyse) Next Generation Market Data System.

      My chief effort was extensive scripting in Python, including:
      * The Universal Playback Parser (**UPP**) for wide variety of market data formats,
        from delimited ASCII to pure binary.
        * The parser used CSV exports of business requirements (sheets with fields'
        meaning) and a symbol-based language for specifying the feed's underlying
        format.
      * The Pretty Printer script filtering and presenting the UPP-decoded market
        data in usable formats (JSON or human-readable).
      * Automatic data checker, using the UPP to parse north and south side data:
        * simulates key parts of Orion's functionality using a CSV spreadsheet with
          mappings of messages, fields and logical conditions;
        * scans current message routing configuration (XML) and simulates proper routing
        * compares resulting data streams and reports items lost, modified and unexpected.
