# CV YAML

Intent: stop fiddling with raw HTML when updating the resume.


# The PLN

1. Define a YAML structure reasonably representing a CV
1. Render it as HTML
    1. With React? To not have to think about a backend.
1. Allow creation of a YAML-encoded CV like most recruitment portals do (HTML forms)
1. Export as DOC, PDF.
1. Hooks mapping to popular recruitment portal's CV creation forms, puppetter them with a webdriver.
